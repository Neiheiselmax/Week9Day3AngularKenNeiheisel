# Week9Day3AngularKenNeiheisel

## The assignment: "Create a full CRUD application of your choosing that is built with AngularJS."

### My Approach: My dad and I have been talking about getting a website for his art together ever since I started the program (9 weeks ago). 
I figured an open ended project like this was a perfect opportunity for this, so we put some wireframes together and I started plugging away. 

### Tech Used: HTML/CSS Bootstrap Sass Javascript Angular 1.x mLab Node 

#### Current Version: In-progress
